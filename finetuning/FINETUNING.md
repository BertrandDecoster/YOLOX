# Comprehensive YOLOX Finetuning Guide for New Object Classes

## 1. Data Gathering Strategy

**Quality over quantity principle**: Start with 500-1000 high-quality images per new class minimum. More diverse data leads to better generalization.

**Data collection approaches**:
- **Real-world capture**: Use multiple cameras, angles, lighting conditions, backgrounds, and distances. Capture objects in their natural context.
- **Web scraping**: Use Google Images, Flickr API, or specialized datasets. Ensure licensing compliance.
- **Synthetic generation**: Use 3D rendering, GANs, or augmentation tools for rare objects.
- **Video extraction**: Extract frames from videos at different intervals to get temporal variety.

**Critical considerations**:
- **Diversity**: Vary object sizes (small, medium, large in frame), orientations, occlusions, and environmental conditions.
- **Edge cases**: Include partially visible objects, crowded scenes, unusual angles, and challenging lighting.
- **Negative samples**: Include images without your target object to reduce false positives.
- **Class balance**: If adding to existing classes, maintain reasonable balance (no more than 10:1 ratio).

## 2. Data Labeling Process

**Annotation tools selection**:
- **LabelImg**: Simple, fast for small datasets, exports YOLO format directly.
- **CVAT**: Web-based, supports team collaboration, interpolation for videos.
- **Labelbox/V7/Roboflow**: Commercial options with AI-assisted labeling, quality control features.
- **Label Studio**: Open-source, flexible, supports pre-annotation with existing models.

**Labeling best practices**:
- **Tight bounding boxes**: Include all visible parts, but minimize background. Consistency is key.
- **Occlusion handling**: Label partially visible objects if >20% visible. Mark heavily occluded objects as "difficult".
- **Small objects**: Don't skip small instances - YOLOX handles multi-scale well.
- **Ambiguous cases**: Create labeling guidelines document. When uncertain, include rather than exclude.
- **Quality control**: Have 10% overlap between annotators, measure inter-annotator agreement.

**COCO format structure** (YOLOX native):
```json
{
  "images": [{id, file_name, height, width}],
  "annotations": [{id, image_id, category_id, bbox[x,y,w,h], area, iscrowd}],
  "categories": [{id, name, supercategory}]
}
```

**Conversion from other formats**:
- YOLO format: bbox center coordinates → top-left coordinates
- Pascal VOC: XML parsing → JSON structure
- Custom formats: Write converters maintaining spatial accuracy

## 3. Dataset Preparation and Structure

**Directory organization**:
```
datasets/
├── your_dataset/
│   ├── train2017/
│   │   ├── image1.jpg
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── val2017/
│   │   ├── image1.jpg
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── annotations/
│   │   ├── instances_train2017.json
│   │   └── instances_val2017.json
```

**Data splitting strategy**:
- **Training set**: 70-80% of data. Should represent full diversity.
- **Validation set**: 10-15%. Used for hyperparameter tuning, early stopping.
- **Test set**: 10-15%. Never seen during training, final performance metric.
- **Stratified splitting**: Ensure each split has proportional class representation.

**Preprocessing considerations**:
- **Image standardization**: Convert to RGB, common formats (JPEG/PNG).
- **Resolution handling**: YOLOX handles multiple scales, but extreme variations need attention.
- **Corrupt file detection**: Validate all images load correctly before training.
- **Annotation validation**: Check bbox coordinates are within image bounds.

**Data augmentation planning**:
- **Built-in YOLOX augmentations**: Mosaic, MixUp, HSV shifts, affine transforms.
- **Additional augmentations**: Consider domain-specific augmentations (weather, blur, noise).
- **Augmentation probability tuning**: Start with defaults, adjust based on validation performance.

## 4. Model Configuration for New Classes

**Choosing base model architecture**:
- **YOLOX-Nano**: Mobile/edge deployment, <1M parameters.
- **YOLOX-Tiny/S**: Good balance, general purposes.
- **YOLOX-M/L**: Higher accuracy, more compute resources.
- **YOLOX-X**: Maximum accuracy, significant resources required.

**Transfer learning strategies**:
1. **Full finetuning**: Update all weights. Best for sufficient data (>5K images/class).
2. **Head-only finetuning**: Freeze backbone, update detection head. For limited data.
3. **Progressive unfreezing**: Start with head, gradually unfreeze deeper layers.

**Class configuration approaches**:
- **Adding to COCO classes**: Keep existing 80 classes, add new ones (81, 82, ...).
- **Replacing classes**: Modify specific class slots if similar objects.
- **Starting fresh**: New dataset with only your classes for specialized applications.

**Architecture modifications**:
- **Detection head channels**: Adjust for number of classes (num_classes parameter).
- **Anchor-free design**: No anchor configuration needed (YOLOX advantage).
- **FPN levels**: Consider modifying for specific object scales.
- **Loss weight balancing**: Adjust cls_loss, reg_loss, obj_loss ratios for your data.

**Pretrained weight handling**:
- **COCO pretrained**: Best starting point for most cases.
- **Partial loading**: Load compatible layers when class numbers differ.
- **Domain-specific pretrained**: Use if available (e.g., medical, aerial imagery).

## 5. Training Configuration and Hyperparameters

**Key hyperparameters for finetuning**:

**Learning rate scheduling**:
- **Initial LR**: Start lower than training from scratch (1e-4 to 1e-3).
- **Warmup**: 500-1000 iterations to stabilize training.
- **Schedule**: Cosine annealing or step decay. Reduce LR when validation plateaus.
- **Different LR for layers**: Higher LR for head, lower for backbone layers.

**Batch size optimization**:
- **Memory constraints**: Larger batches generally better, but fit within GPU memory.
- **Gradient accumulation**: Simulate larger batches on limited hardware.
- **Batch size-LR scaling**: Linear scaling rule - double batch size, double LR.
- **Minimum effective batch**: At least 16-32 for stable training with batch norm.

**Training duration**:
- **Epochs**: 50-100 for finetuning (vs 300 from scratch).
- **Early stopping**: Monitor validation mAP, patience of 10-20 epochs.
- **Overfitting indicators**: Training loss decreases but validation loss increases.

**Data augmentation tuning**:
- **Mosaic probability**: 0.5-1.0 for diverse scenes, lower for consistent backgrounds.
- **MixUp alpha**: 0.2-0.5, higher values for more regularization.
- **HSV augmentation**: Adjust based on lighting variation in your data.
- **Copy-paste**: Enable for small object detection improvement.

**Advanced configurations**:
- **Multi-scale training**: Enable for better scale invariance.
- **EMA decay**: 0.9998-0.9999 for stable predictions.
- **Label smoothing**: 0.0-0.1 to prevent overconfidence.
- **Gradient clipping**: Prevent explosion in early training.

## 6. Training Process and Monitoring

**Pre-training checklist**:
- Verify dataset paths and annotation loading.
- Test data pipeline with single batch visualization.
- Confirm GPU availability and memory requirements.
- Set up experiment tracking (tensorboard/wandb/mlflow).
- Create backup of original model weights.

**Training monitoring metrics**:
- **Loss components**: Track cls_loss, reg_loss, obj_loss separately.
- **Learning rate**: Ensure proper scheduling and warmup.
- **Gradient norms**: Monitor for explosion/vanishing.
- **GPU utilization**: Optimize batch size for efficiency.
- **Training speed**: iterations/second, ETA tracking.

**Validation monitoring**:
